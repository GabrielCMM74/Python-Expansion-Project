API/ADT Interface vs DSA 

Static Sequence Interface 
- build
- len 
- iter-Sequence
- get at

Static Array - Model computation (Word RAM model)
- memory is an Array of word rams-bit. Our memory is divided into words and called bits, 
and access it at a specific location
- if you want to access the Array[i]
Then that means memory[address(array) + i]
Meaning I can access my RAM and get the value
